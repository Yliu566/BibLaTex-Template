@article{Chiechi2008,
	Abstract = {This paper describes the electrical characteristics of junctions composed of three-dimensional arrays of colloidal CdSe quantum dots (QDs) with tin-doped indium oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and eutectic GaIn (EGaIn) electrodes. It focuses on a comparison of junctions containing QDs of one size to those of arrays containing QDs of multiple sizes. This comparison makes it possible to estimate the relative contributions of transport across various interfaces (e.g., between the QDs and between the QDs and the electrodes) to the observed electrical characteristics of the junction and to evaluate the dependence of these contributions on the locations of various sizes of QDs within the junction. The junctions were diodes, and their turn-on voltage depended on the size of the QDs next to the PEDOT:PSS. We describe this dependence using a Marcus model to estimate the barrier for charge transfer induced by the difference in energies between the orbitals of the QDs and the valence band of PEDOT:PSS.},
